# diceGameChallenge
Initial template repository for the dice game challenge

### The Brief
- Katrina is developing a two player dice game
- The players roll two six-sided dice each and get points depending on what they roll
- There are 5 rounds in the game

### The Rules
- The points rolled on each player’s dice are added to their score
- If the total is an even number, an additional 10 points are added to their score.
- If the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score.
- If they roll a double, they get to roll one extra die and get the number of points rolled added to their score.
- The score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point.
- The person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.
- If both players have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, they each roll 1 die and whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins).

### The Task
- Allows two players to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are authorised players.
- Allows each player to roll two 6-sided dice.
- Calculates and outputs the points for each round and each player’s total score.
- Allows the players to play 5 rounds.
- If both players have the same score after 5 rounds, allows each player to roll 1 die each until someone wins.
- Outputs who has won at the end of the 5 rounds.
- Stores the winner’s score, and their name, in an external file.
- Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.
